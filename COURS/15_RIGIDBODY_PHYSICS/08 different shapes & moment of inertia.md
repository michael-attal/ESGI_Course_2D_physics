**Moment of Inertia for Different Shapes**

We just learned that the _moment of inertia_ is the equivalent of _mass_, but for rotation. The moment of inertia of an object tells how hard it is for that object to change its rotation, and this is why you'll see people call it _"angular mass."_

This is true for both 2D and 3D objects, but 2D moment of inertia is a lot simpler than 3D, since in 3-dimensions we need a matrix to represent different inertia values for different axis.

The animation below was created by Lucas Vieira (public domain, Wikipedia). Pay attention how different shapes end up with different rotation speeds.

Here we can see how different shapes (solid cylinder, hollow cylinder, solid circle, etc.) behave differently when they rotate down the plane.

This is the _moment of inertia_ in action, which takes into account the shape and also the mass of each object.
